  <p>It an octagon-shaped radiant gem.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Shape: It's an eight-sided (octagon) gem.</li>
    <li>
      Octagonal Facets: As you can see, the primary shape is an octagon. This
      means it has eight flat, polished surfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      Step Cuts: Instead of a smooth, continuous curve between each facet, the
      ruby is cut with distinct "steps." These steps are relatively wide and
      clearly defined, creating a strong contrast between the light-colored
      areas (where light enters) and the darker areas (where the light is
      reflected).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The step-cut is a classic cut that highlights the color and clarity of the
    gem. Itâ€™s a particularly elegant cut that showcases the gem's depth and
    brilliance.
