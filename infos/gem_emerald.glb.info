  <p>This gem is a faceted emerald.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Shape: The gem has a classic, rectangular step-cut shape, common for
      emeralds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Facet Pattern: The multiple facets suggest it is a step-cut emerald,
      designed to maximize the gem's brilliance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rectangular: The overall form is a straight-sided rectangle, not rounded
      like a round brilliant cut.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The step cut is its key characteristic. Instead of being cut into a
    continuous, curved surface like a brilliant cut, the emerald is cut into
    flat, parallel steps.
